# Stuff I didn't make myself

- The logo was made by [Vyctor](https://github.com/Vyctor661/). He also gave me ideas for the design.
- Some of the auth stuff was originally taken from [this repo](https://github.com/thomashoneyman/purescript-halogen-realworld/)
- All the purescript dependencies I used are listed in spago.dhall
- Other tooling I used can be found in package.json

## Why are there other contributors?

Victor Sandu helped me with some design ideas & feedback and ImperialWater helped me with ideas and by fixing some typos
